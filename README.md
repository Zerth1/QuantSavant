**An experimental game that strains numerical processing and abilities**

**Digit Processing:** In digit processing, you are flashed with a series of numbers. Lets say you are flashed with 10 numbers which can be changed in settings. After, you are presented with 4 * 10 numbers sequentially. 3 / 4 of those are fakes that were manually constructed and you have to determine the 1 / 4 which were presented in the flashing phase. The fakes intentionally blend in pretty well with the real ones.\

**Flash Anzan:** You are presented with a series of numbers to sum up in a time frame and are supposed to output the correct result.

**Flash Anzan ULTRA:** 2D MOT + Flash Anzan Combination (Very Hard)

**N-Back ULTRA:**: A mathematical twist on the classical N-Back game (Very Hard).
Settings: 
- Position Stimuli: Determines whether or not position will be considered as a stimuli.
- Anagraming Stimuli: Determines whether or not anagraming will be considered as a stimuli.
- Audio Stimuli: Determines whether or not audio will be considered as a stimuli.
- N: For every colored object, you are supposed to manipulate the information of the object from n-trials ago to find a match.
- ConcurrentNumbers: Determines how many colored objects appear on the screen per generation
- GridSize: The dimensions of the grid in terms of cell count.
